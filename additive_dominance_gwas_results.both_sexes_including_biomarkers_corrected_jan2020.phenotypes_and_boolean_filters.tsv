If the participant updated their home address during their assessment centre visit, then that postcode was used as the source instead. The location co-ordinates use the Ordnance Survey (OSGB) reference, rounded to the nearest Kilometre. This North co-ordinate needs to be used in conjunction with the East co-ordinate in ~F20074~. For most purposes, grid co-ordinates rounded to a 1Km distance will provide sufficient information on location of residence at assessment. Research proposals that require location details to a finer level of granularity (i.e. 100m) should request ~F20033~ and ~F20034~, however special approval will be required to release the more detailed information.	20075_irnt	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
